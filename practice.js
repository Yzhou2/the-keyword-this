//We're in a job interview. Answer the following questions (try to not look at your notes unless you have to).
  // 1) What is the purpose of the 'this keyword'?

      //To refer an object//Answer

  // 2) What are the four rules that govern what the 'this keyword' is bound to and describe each?

      //when a function is contained in a global scope, "this" keyword in that function refers to the window object.
      //whenever a function is called by a preceding dot, the object before the dot is "this".
      //whenever a construction function is used, this is the object that's being created and returned by the constructor function.
     //whenever apply or call is used, this is explicitly defined. 
  
  
  //3) What is the difference between call and apply?

      //apply lets you invoke the function with arguments as an array; call requires the parameters be listed explicitly
      //apply() requires an array as the second parameter. The array represents the arguments for the target method.//Answer

  // 4) What does .bind do?

      //bind will create a function that will have the first parameter set to be this//Answer


//Next Problem

//Create an object called user which has the following properties.
  //username --> which is a string
  //email --> which is a string
  //getUsername --> which is a function that returns the current object's username property. *Don't use 'user' instead use the 'this' keyword*

    var user = {
      username:"cindy",
      email:"cindy@gmail",
      getUsername: function() {return this.username;}
    }//Code Here

//Now, invoke the getUsername method and verify you got the username of the object and not anything else.


user.getUsername(); //Next Problem


// Write a constructor function, including method definitions, which will make the following function invocations function properly.

  function Car(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
    this.move = 0;
    this.moveCar = function() {
      console.log(this.move)
      this.move += 10;
      return this.move;
    }
  }//Function Invocations Here

var prius = new Car('Toyota', 'Prius', 2011);
var mustang = new Car('Ford', 'Mustang', 2013);

//Hint, you'll need to add a move property, with a starting value of zero, and write a moveCar function which will increment the 
//move property by 10. The move property will be added to every object that is being returned from the Car function. 
//You'll also need to use the 'this' keyword properly in order to make sure you're invoking moveCar on the right object 
//(prius vs mustang).

prius.moveCar(); //increments prius' move property by 10. Returns the new move property.
mustang.moveCar(); //increments mustang' move property by 10. Returns the new move property.



//Continuation of previous problem

var getYear = function(){
  return this.year;
};

//Above you're given the getYear function. Call the getYear function with the prius then the mustang objects being the focal objects. 
//*Don't add getYear as a property on both objects*.

//Note(no tests)
  prius.getYear;
  mustang.getYear;//Code Here


//New Problem

var myUser = {
 username: 'iliketurtles',
 age: 13,
 email: 'iliketurtles@gmail.com'
};

var getMyUsername = function() {
 return this.username;
};

var userName = getMyUsername.call(myUser); //Fix this

//Above you're given an object, and  a function. What will the getMyUsername function return?
//Note(no tests)
  //window's username;//Answer Here

//In the example above, what is the 'this keyword' bound to when getMyUsername runs?

  //windows//Answer Here


//Fix the getMyUsername invocation (stored in the userName variable, at the bottom of the above code) so that userName will be 
//equal to 'iliketurtles'.
